# kotlin-sample
Kotlin sample project.

Here, I have used MySQL Sakila sample database (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).<br>
To interact with DB, I am using Kotlin exposed package (https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DAO#basic-crud-operations).<br>
Data classes are helpful in interacting with the DB.<br>
Service classes are used to write business logic and controllers are used as an intermeditary (To pass the request and get the response).<br>
Also, domain objects are created for interaction with outide world.
