# kotlin-sample
Kotlin sample project.

Here, I have used MySQL database.
To interact with DB, I am using Kotlin exposed package (https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DAO#basic-crud-operations).
Data classes are helpful in interacting with the DB.
Service classes are used to write business logic and controllers are used as an intermeditary (To pass the request and get the response).
Also, domain objects are created for interaction with outide world.
